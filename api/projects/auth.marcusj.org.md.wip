# [auth.marcusj.org](https://auth.marcusj.org)

This project was originally created on Replit, as an alternative to [repl auth](https://docs.replit.com/hosting/authenticating-users-repl-auth). It was designed to be as easy to implement while allowing non-replit users to authenticate with your project.
