# [Good day Bad day](https://gdbd.marcusj.org)

I built this website so I could keep tally of the amount of times I perform what I deem a "good" task, or a "bad" task. It has a history feature, so you can see your score for the past week/month/etc. I find this useful because often at the end of my week, I find I have forgotten what the highs and lows were.
